# Statistical Simulation(Under Constant Construction)

### Simulation studies investigating interesting phenomenon in real world.

1. Mixed Model Selection consistency: a comparison view.
2. Variable Selection for high-dimensional data via lasso.
3. Comparison of xgboost and random forest on predictors with highly correlated features.
4. EM-Solver for survival data with weibull distribution.
