# Statistical Simulation(Under Constant Construction)

### Simulation studies investigating interesting phenomenon in real world.

1. Variable Selection for high-dimensional data via lasso.
Try different n/p ratio and investigate the regularization path.

2. Comparison of xgboost and random forest on predictors with highly correlated features.
Simulate a bundle of continuous features with sequential correlation and categorical variables, fit random forest and xgboost models. 

3. Comparison of Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and the permutation test for comparing two distributions.

4. Simulate linear mixed-effects model and argument of the inconsistency in high-dimensional covariance structure.
