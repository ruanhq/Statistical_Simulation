# Statistical Simulation(Under Constant Construction)

### Simulation studies investigating interesting phenomenon in real world.

1. Variable Selection for high-dimensional data via lasso.
2. Comparison of xgboost and random forest on predictors with highly correlated features.
3. Comparison of Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and the permutation test for comparing two distributions.
4. Simulate linear mixed-effects model and argument of the inconsistency in high-dimensional covariance structure.
